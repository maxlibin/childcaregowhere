Ichiban Montessori aims to provide a dynamic, independent learning environment that is hands-on and student-driven for children ages 2 to 6 years old. Children develop inner-discipline, a love of learning, and learn at their own pace guided by the Montessori technique, which promotes individual initiative and creativity. We want our students to experience such a positive impact on their learning that our parents would never consider having them attend pre-school anywhere else!"},{"tp_code":"na","centre_code":"PT3150","centre_name":"BUMBLE BEE CHILD CARE CENTRE","organisation_code":"PT","organisation_description":"PRIVATE","centre_operating_model":"CCC","centre_contact_no":63630234,"centre_email_address":"support@bumbleb3.com","centre_address":"Blk 369, WOODLANDS AVENUE 1, #01 - 853, SINGAPORE 730369","postal_code":730369,"centre_website":"www.facebook.com/bumblebeeccc","infant_vacancy":"na","pg_vacancy":"Immediate vacancies","n1_vacancy":"Immediate vacancies","n2_vacancy":"Vacancies within 6 months","k1_vacancy":"Immediate vacancies","k2_vacancy":"Immediate vacancies","food_offered":"No Pork No Lard with No Beef(without Certification from MUIS but from Halal Sources)","second_languages_offered":"Chinese","spark_certified":"No","weekday_full_day":"07:00-19:30","weekday_halfday_am":"na","weekday_halfday_pm":"na","saturday":"07:00-14:00","scheme_type":"na","extended_operating_hours":"Yes","provision_of_transport":"No","iccp":"No","government_subsidy":"Yes","gst_regisration":"No","last_updated":"2019-02-10","remarks":"na"},{"tp_code":"na","centre_code":"PT3190","centre_name":"BLOSSOM EDUCARE CENTRE LLP","organisation_code":"PT","organisation_description":"PRIVATE","centre_operating_model":"CCC","centre_contact_no":63820560,"centre_email_address":"bec@blossomedugroup.com.sg","centre_address":"7, LORONG BATAWI, SINGAPORE 536668","postal_code":536668,"centre_website":"www.blossomedugroup.com.sg","infant_vacancy":"na","pg_vacancy":"Immediate vacancies","n1_vacancy":"Immediate vacancies","n2_vacancy":"Immediate vacancies","k1_vacancy":"Immediate vacancies","k2_vacancy":"Immediate vacancies","food_offered":"No Pork No Lard with No Beef(without Certification from MUIS but from Halal Sources)","second_languages_offered":"Chinese","spark_certified":"No","weekday_full_day":"07:00-19:00","weekday_halfday_am":"07:00-13:00","weekday_halfday_pm":"13:00-19:00","saturday":"07:00-14:00","scheme_type":"na","extended_operating_hours":"No","provision_of_transport":"Yes","iccp":"No","government_subsidy":"Yes","gst_regisration":"No","last_updated":"2019-03-10","remarks":"Blossom Edugroup is a consortium of educational institutions that prides ourselves as providers of quality child care and pre-school education in Singapore since 2002.

Carpe Diem @ Hilltop is sited atop an elevated plane, which is both exclusive and accessible, and thus affords it the vast open field, fresh air and generous outdoor space that are highly conducive for a rich education.  Thanks to its expansive space and greenery, Carpe Diem @ Hilltop is able to incorporate a host of outdoor amenities that promotes explorative and experiential learning, such as: a children's playground; a pet house; areas for outdoor cycling, art and craft activities, sand play and water play; a vegetable and fruit garden; and alfresco dining. We are also exploring the feasibility to build a tree- house to double up as an outdoor classroom.   Coupled with the integrated Multiple Intelligences (MI) curriculum developed by renowned educational psychologist, Dr Howard Gardner (Harvard University), Carpe Diem @ Hilltop is set to be the best start to your child's lifelong learning journey.  With a reliable reputation that has earned us the Superbrands award for three consecutive years (2004, 2005 and 2006), Singapore Prestige Brand Award in 2009, rest assured that Carpe Diem is Your Partner in Your Child's Development.
